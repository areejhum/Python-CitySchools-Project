### Python-CitySchools-project



 In this project, the data has been aggregated and shown as obvious trends in school performance. Then, tried helped to make the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Then, made a report including the summary district. As a first task, school dataset've analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The main  responsibility is to calcolatee the data to find answers of plenty of questions, and showcase a worthy trends in school performance.

The final report nclude each of the following:

### District Summary

The district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
